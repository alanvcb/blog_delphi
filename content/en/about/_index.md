## Who is the Delphi Roughneck?

A seasoned, no-nonsense, shop-floor kind of Delphi developer —  
20+ years fixing bugs the hard way, keeping legacy systems alive, and wrestling with code others are too scared to touch.

Around here we talk straight, work rough, and debug faster than the compiler crashes.

Welcome to the workshop, partner. 🤠
